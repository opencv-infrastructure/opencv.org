<p>Unfortunately one of our admin accounts on SourceForge has been taken over for a small period of time. Some files has been replaced with possibly malicious program.</p>

<p>Affected files:
  <ul>
    <li><i>4.0.1/opencv-4.0.1-vc14_vc15.exe</i> - file reuploaded, correct SHA1 sum is <i>d9b208c250e3cc136ddfc5d17fa9c82e52c5ce3a</i>.
    <li><i>4.0.0-alpha/*</i> - directory removed
  </ul>
